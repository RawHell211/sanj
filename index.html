  <!-- 3️⃣ CUSTOM PERSONALITY PARAGRAPH -->
  <section class="screen">
    <h1>Alright! Here we go!</h1>

    <p class="big-text">
    When i first saw you, you looked absolutely beautiful. You had left your hair open that day like you do most of the time but since that was the first time i saw you, i was absolutely mesmerised by you and i still am. I know i have mentioned about the red top you wear too and you look so gorgeous in that. Damn. 
   What I really like about you is the way you are as a person. You think
      things through, you care about how your choices affect others, and you
      never take people’s feelings lightly. You’re mature, kind, and very
      understanding, and that shows in the way you handle situations. I also
      like how patient you are and how you don’t rush into things just because
      it feels easy. Getting to know you made me like you for who you truly are,
      not just at first glance. The more I saw this side of you, the more I
      liked you, and that honestly means a lot to me.
